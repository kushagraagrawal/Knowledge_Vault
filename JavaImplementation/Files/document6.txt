Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma,[7] is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung.[10] This growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body.[11] Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas.[12] The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).[3] The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.[1]

The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking.[4] About 10–15% of cases occur in people who have never smoked.[13] These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution.[4][5][14][15] Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans.[7] The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance.[6][16]

Avoidance of risk factors, including smoking and air pollution, is the primary method of prevention.[17] Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health.[7] Most cases are not curable.[3] Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.[7] NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.[18]

Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths.[12] This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer.[19] The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years.[2] Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis,[2] while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world

Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include:[1]

Respiratory symptoms: coughing, coughing up blood, wheezing, or shortness of breath
Systemic symptoms: weight loss, weakness, fever, or clubbing of the fingernails
Symptoms due to the cancer mass pressing on adjacent structures: chest pain, bone pain, superior vena cava obstruction, or difficulty swallowing
If the cancer grows in the airways, it may obstruct airflow, causing breathing difficulties. The obstruction can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage, and predispose to pneumonia.[1]

Depending on the type of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local presence of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease.[21] In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), ectopic ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors in the top of the lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.[1]

Many of the symptoms of lung cancer (poor appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue) are not specific.[6] In many people, the cancer has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention.[22] Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss, bone pain and neurological symptoms (headaches, fainting, convulsions, or limb weakness).[1] Common sites of spread include the brain, bone, adrenal glands, opposite lung, liver, pericardium, and kidneys.[22] About 10% of people with lung cancer do not have symptoms at diagnosis; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography.[16]


Cancer develops after genetic damage to DNA and epigenetic changes. Those changes affect the cell's normal functions, including cell proliferation, programmed cell death (apoptosis), and DNA repair. As more damage accumulates, the risk of cancer increases.[23]

Smoking
Tobacco smoking is by far the main contributor to lung cancer.[4] Cigarette smoke contains at least 73 known carcinogens,[24] including benzo[a]pyrene,[25] NNK, 1,3-butadiene, and a radioactive isotope of polonium – polonium-210.[24] Across the developed world, 90% of lung cancer deaths in men and 70% of those in women during the year 2000 were attributed to smoking.[26] Smoking accounts for about 85% of lung cancer cases.[7]

Passive smoking – the inhalation of smoke from another's smoking – is a cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker can be defined as someone either living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US,[27][28][29] Europe,[30] and the UK[31] have consistently shown a significantly-increased risk among those exposed to passive smoking.[32] Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk.[33] Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest that it is more dangerous than direct smoke.[34] Passive smoking results in roughly 3,400 lung cancer-related deaths each year in the U.S.[29]

Marijuana smoke contains many of the same carcinogens as those in tobacco smoke.[35] However, the effect of smoking cannabis on lung cancer risk is not clear.[36][37] A 2013 review did not find an increased risk from light to moderate use.[38] A 2014 review found that smoking cannabis doubled the risk of lung cancer.[39]

Radon gas
Radon is a colorless and odorless gas generated by the breakdown of radioactive radium, which in turn is the decay product of uranium, found in the Earth's crust. The radiation decay products ionize genetic material, causing mutations that sometimes become cancerous. Radon is the second-most common cause of lung cancer in the US,[40] causing about 21,000 deaths each year.[41] The risk increases 8–16% for every 100 Bq/m³ increase in the radon concentration.[42] Radon gas levels vary by locality and the composition of the underlying soil and rocks. About one in 15 homes in the US have radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/l) (148 Bq/m³).[43]

Asbestos
Asbestos can cause a variety of lung diseases such as lung cancer. Tobacco smoking and asbestos both have synergistic effects on the development of lung cancer.[5] In smokers who work with asbestos, the risk of lung cancer is increased 45-fold compared to the general population.[44] Asbestos can also cause cancer of the pleura, called mesothelioma – which actually is different from lung cancer.[45]

Air pollution
Outdoor air pollutants, especially chemicals released from the burning of fossil fuels, increase the risk of lung cancer.[4] Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with a slightly-increased risk.[4][46] For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%.[47] Outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause 1–2% of lung cancers.[4]

Tentative evidence supports an increased risk of lung cancer from indoor air pollution in relation to the burning of wood, charcoal, dung, or crop residue for cooking and heating.[48] Women who are exposed to indoor coal smoke have roughly twice the risk, and many of the by-products of burning biomass are known or suspected carcinogens.[49] This risk affects about 2.4 billion people worldwide,[48] and it is believed to result in 1.5% of lung cancer deaths.[49]

Genetics
About 8% of lung cancer is caused by inherited factors.[50] In relatives of people that are diagnosed with lung cancer, the risk is doubled, likely due to a combination of genes.[51] Polymorphisms on chromosomes 5, 6, and 15 are known to affect the risk of lung cancer.[52] Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the genes encoding the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) – CHRNA5, CHRNA3, and CHRNB4 – are of those associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, as well as RGS17 – a gene regulating G-protein signaling.[52]

Other causes
Numerous other substances, occupations, and environmental exposures have been linked to lung cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) states that there is some "sufficient evidence" to show that the following are carcinogenic in the lungs:[53]

Some metals (aluminium production, cadmium and cadmium compounds, chromium(VI) compounds, beryllium and beryllium compounds, iron and steel founding, nickel compounds, arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds, and underground hematite mining)
Some products of combustion (incomplete combustion, coal (indoor emissions from household coal burning), coal gasification, coal-tar pitch, coke production, soot, and diesel engine exhaust)
Ionizing radiation (X-radiation, gamma radiation, and plutonium)
Some toxic gases (methyl ether (technical grade), and bis-(chloromethyl) ether, sulfur mustard, MOPP (vincristine-prednisone-nitrogen mustard-procarbazine mixture) and fumes from painting)
Rubber production and crystalline silica dust
There is a small increase in the risk of lung cancer in people affected by systemic sclerosis.

Performing a chest radiograph is one of the first investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may be suggestive of lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, the widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (lung collapse), consolidation (pneumonia), or pleural effusion.[7] CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopic or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.[16]

Lung cancer often appears as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph. However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas caused by tuberculosis, histoplasmosis or coccidioidomycosis.[64] Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason.[65] The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on the histological examination of the suspicious tissue[1] in the context of the clinical and radiological features.[6]

Clinical practice guidelines recommend frequencies for pulmonary nodule surveillance.[66] CT imaging should not be used for longer or more frequently than indicated, as the extended surveillance exposes people to increased radiation and is costly.[66]


Lung cancers are classified according to histological type.[6] This classification is important for determining both the management and predicting outcomes of the disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas – malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.[68]

While in most countries industrial and domestic carcinogens have been identified and banned, tobacco smoking is still widespread. Eliminating tobacco smoking is a primary goal in the prevention of lung cancer, and smoking cessation is an important preventive tool in this process.[79]

Policy interventions to decrease passive smoking in public areas such as restaurants and workplaces have become more common in many Western countries.[80] Bhutan has had a complete smoking ban since 2005[81] while India introduced a ban on smoking in public in October 2008.[82] The World Health Organization has called for governments to institute a total ban on tobacco advertising to prevent young people from taking up smoking. They assess that such bans have reduced tobacco consumption by 16% where instituted.[83]

Screening
Main article: Lung cancer screening
Cancer screening uses medical tests to detect disease in large groups of people who have no symptoms.[84] For individuals with high risk of developing lung cancer, computed tomography (CT) screening can detect cancer and give a person options to respond to it in a way that prolongs life.[66][85] This form of screening reduces the chance of death from lung cancer by an absolute amount of 0.3% (relative amount of 20%).[86][87] High risk people are those age 55–74 who have smoked equivalent amount of a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years including time within the past 15 years.[66]

CT screening is associated with a high rate of falsely positive tests which may result in unneeded treatment.[88] For each true positive scan there are about 19 falsely positives scans.[89] Other concerns include radiation exposure[88] and the cost of testing along with follow up.[66] Research has not found two other available tests—sputum cytology or chest radiograph (CXR) screening tests—to have any benefit.[85][90]

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends yearly screening using low-dose computed tomography in those who have a total smoking history of 30 pack-years and are between 55 and 80 years old until a person has not been smoking for more than 15 years.[91] Screening should not be done in those with other health problems that would make treatment of lung cancer if found not an option.[91] The English National Health Service was in 2014 re-examining the evidence for screening.[92]

Other prevention strategies
The long-term use of supplemental vitamin A,[93][94] vitamin C,[93] vitamin D[95] or vitamin E[93] does not reduce the risk of lung cancer. Some studies suggest that people who eat diets with a higher proportion of vegetables and fruit tend to have a lower risk,[29][96] but this may be due to confounding—with the lower risk actually due to the association of a high fruit and vegetables diet with less smoking.[97] Several rigorous studies have not demonstrated a clear association between diet and lung cancer risk,[1][96] although meta-analysis that accounts for smoking status may show benefit from a healthy diet.[98]
